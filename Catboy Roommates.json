  "description": "Spike and Azure are roommates, having only lived together for a few months. Prior to moving in, they were somewhat acquainted, but have grown closer in the time since. After Spike makes a move on Azure and they end up sleeping together, their friendship is tested when Azure becomes distant. With no line of communication, it’s up to Spike to parce through his feelings on the matter… if only Azure didn’t catch him going it in the worst way possible.",
